            <p><strong>Status:</strong> Ongoing</p>
            <p><strong>Type:</strong> Natural</p>
            <p><strong>Affected Country:</strong> Krygystan</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong>According to the Republican Center for Immunoprophylaxis of the Ministry of Health of the Kyrgyz Republic, since the beginning of 2023, the epidemiological situation in the country for measles and rubella has deteriorated. The first cases were reported in the first epidemiological week in Bishkek city and Chui regions, and, starting from the eighth epidemiological week, it has spread to Osh city and Osh region. Then it has spread to an additional 34 districts in 5 regions. The government of the Kyrgyz Republic has not officially declared an outbreak. For reference, as per the WHO, the definition of a suspected measles outbreak is five or more measles cases (with dates of rash onset occurring 7–21 days apart) that are epidemiologically linked, and the definition of a laboratory-confirmed measles outbreak is two or more laboratory-confirmed measles cases that are temporally related (with dates of rash onset occurring 7–21 days apart) and epidemiologically or virologically linked, or both). As of 21 August 2023, 2,743 suspected cases of measles and/or rubella were reported, from which 1,774 were classified as measles (945 laboratory confirmed cases, 323 clinically confirmed cases, and 506 are epidemiologically linked). Measles incidence per 1 million population for the period of May 2022 to April 2023 is 49.47 cases, which is the second highest in the WHO Europe region. The country reported 11 cases of rubella in the period between May 2022 and April 2023, the fourth highest in the WHO Europe region during this period. On 14 August, the Ministry of Health of the Kyrgyz Republic announced two confirmed deaths due to complications of measles. One (1) case was reported in Bishkek (a three-year old child) and one (1) case in Chui region (a one-year old child). In both cases, the children were not vaccinated according to the National vaccination calendar, as parents decided against immunization due to religious reasons.</p>
