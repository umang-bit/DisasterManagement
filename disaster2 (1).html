            <p><strong>Description:</strong>Severe damages have been inflicted upon the Chattogram Division (Chittangon), specifically in the districts of Chattogram, Bandarban, Cox's Bazar, and Rangamati, due to heavy rainfall and water flowing down from the hills. The UNOSAT FloodAI Monitoring Dashboard reported a total exposed population of 2.4 million in the four districts between 5 to 10 August 2023, with 1.2 million people affected. The Divisional Health Office Chattogram reported 26 casualties as of 10 August. Humanitarian organizations reported that a staggering 90 per cent of the Bandarban district has been submerged in water. (OCHA, 13 Aug 2023)

                Since August 5, continuous monsoon rains have affected Chattogram, Cox’s Bazar, Rangamati, and Bandarban. Heavy rainfall, ranging from 44 to 89 mm, led to flash floods and landslides in the Hill Tracts, especially in Bandarban town and nearby areas. 1.3 million people including 630,000 women and 480,000 children (0-19 years old) are affected while 600,000 people are in need of humanitarian assistance in four districts (Chattogram, Cox’s Bazar, Ragamati, and Bandarban), with 51 deaths reported. Major rivers in the region were overflowing, crippling major transport routes, and resulting in the damage of up to 410 kilometres of roads.</p>
